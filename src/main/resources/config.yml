#Set patrol spawn rate.

#Set Piglin spawn rate.
  #Does not change the piglin count limit, only changes the rate at which the count grows.
piglin-spawn-rate: 100
  #Consider also editing spawn limits, spawn ranges, and spawn timings in your server's files: "bukkit.yml", "spigot.yml", and "paper.yml", etc...

#In order to "abandon" a structure, LiminalMod will sometimes change a structure's blocks. This is the maximum amount of blocks that can be processed per tick.
#Too high, and the server will try to do a lot at once and lag. Too low, and the structure will take a long time to process, wasting time that could be spent on other things.
blocks-per-tick: 128
  #Think of this as trying to fit a Slime through a tunnel, where the tunnel is the server's processing power. One would want to stretch the slime just enough to fit.
