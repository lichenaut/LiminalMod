#Abandonment Speed#
###################

#In order to "abandon" a structure, LiminalMod will sometimes load a structure's chunks.
#The following setting is the amount of time, in ticks, this plugin will wait before loading another chunk.
#Think of this as trying to fit a Slime through a tunnel, where the tunnel is the server's processing power. One would want to stretch the slime just enough to fit.

#Too low, and the server will try to load a lot of chunks at once and lag. Too high, and the structure will take a long time to process, also wasting time.
ticks-per-chunk: 10
