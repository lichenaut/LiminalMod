# LiminalMod
LiminalMod allows for configurable structure spawning, restoring old Minecraft's atmosphere.

## Configuration

### Example

>VILLAGE_PLAINS: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;spawn-rate: 50 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;abandoned-rate: 75 <br>

Plains Villages will spawn 50% of the time, and 75% of those that spawn will not spawn structure-specific mobs.
Obviously, some structures will not have structure-specific mobs, so you wouldn't need to specify that for them.
